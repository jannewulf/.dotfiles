# Welcome $HOME
This repository contains the configuration files of the tools I use.

## Installation
I use [yadm][yadm] for managing my dotfiles.
That's not a requirement, though.
```sh
# Make sure git and yadm are installed
# sudo apt install git yadm
yadm clone https://github.com/jannewulf/.dotfiles
yadm bootstrap
```
